😊 Emojis: Integrated emoji support to make conversations more expressive and engaging.
📎 File Sharing: Send and receive documents, images, and other files without hassle.
📞 Voice and Video Calls: Enabled high-quality voice and video communication for a complete chat experience.

Tech Stack Highlights:
⚛️ React: For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
⚡ Vite: To enhance development speed and application performance.
🔒 TypeScript: Ensured type safety and scalability across the codebase.

What’s Next?
I am eager to take this project to the next level by exploring and implementing new features to enhance the user experience further. Whether it’s advanced personalization, enhanced media sharing, or additional real-time collaboration tools, the possibilities are endless! 🚀
